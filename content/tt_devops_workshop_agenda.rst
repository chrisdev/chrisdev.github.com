=================================== 
Trinidad and Tobago DevOps Workshop
===================================

The Trinidad and Tobago DevOps workshop is a workshop designed to help
participants further their web development prowess through the use of various
modern development technologies. In the workshop. participants will work with
technologies such as VirtualBox, Ansiable and Vagrant. Vagrant is an application
that allows one to create a pre-specified development environment on a local
machine. This allows developers to avoid discrepancies between their machine and
the machine the application will run on when completed. VirtualBox is an
application used to allow for the setup and use of "Guest" operating systems as
an application on your machine without the need for partitioning etc. Ansiable
is a powerful application used to automate the configuration of the development
environments created by using Vagrant and Virtual Box.
