    <p>I was really looking forward to reviewing this book as I'm a big fan of <a class="reference external" href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Zurb
Foundation</a> as I think that it is by far the <a class="reference external" href="http://responsive.vermilion.com/compare.php?framework=current">best</a> responsive framework out
there. Indeed, at work here at <a class="reference external" href="http://chrisdev.com">ChrisDev</a>,  we use Foundation for all our web
based projects.</p>
<p>The book is supposed to aimed at web architects, designers, and builders who
were already familiar with the basics principles of responsive design and
is divided up into four chapters. I found that
<cite>Chapter 1: Getting The Most from the Grid System</cite> was the most useful of the
lot. The author discussed in some detail his approach
to dealing with a number of practical layout issues including: nesting rows in
columns; understanding and customizing column gutters; maintaining row and page
width; mobile first design (or what the author calls designing from small to to
large); rearranging columns and so on.  While I found that this chapter hit
all the basics I felt more emphasis should have been placed on the implications
of mobile first design as this has always been Foundation's big selling
point over rivals such as <a class="reference external" href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter BootStrap</a>.  Also, it was strange
that there was no mention of some of the great resources provided by Zurb such
as the <a class="reference external" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/templates4.html">Foundation 4 Templates</a> which provide a number of canned layouts for
various kinds of sites (blogs, marketing product page etc.) that can be a great
starting point for customizing layout.</p>
<p>I was a little disappointed in the next two chapters which covered the CSS and
JavaScript components provided with Foundation. These seemed a little cursory and
there was little that went beyond the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.foundation.com">online documentation</a>.
Of course Foundation comes with more than twenty CSS components about twelve
JavaScript Plugins so it would have been unrealistic to expect a comprehensive
treatment of all these components, but maybe the author could have singled out
the more popular component such as Orbit for more comprehensive treatment.</p>
<p>The final chapter covered <a class="reference external" href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>. I felt that there was a lot of good material
here and readers unfamiliar with Sass would find it quite enlightening.
I particularly liked the sections entitled <em>Customizing with Variables</em> and
<em>Understanding functions and mixins</em>. However, I felt that more emphasis should
have been placed on this topic given that Sass has become the most efficient
way to customize and style layout, components and plugins.  I would have
preferred if Sass could have been introduced very early on (probably as Chapter
2) and the subsequent chapters covering CSS and JavaScript components each
contain a section on how to customize one or more of the components or plugins
with Sass.</p>
<p>Overall, I would have to give this book a 3 out of 5 stars since it covers the
basics and provides a good supplement for the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.foundation.com">online documentation</a>. However,
I feel that for more experienced designers, architects and builders the book
will prove to be a bit of a disappointment. Aside from <cite>Chapter 1</cite>, it provides
little in the way of a practical approach or even  some guidelines for building
real world responsive sites with Foundation.  This is important in the context
of a rapidly evolving framework like Zurb Foundation, where we are we are
reviewing a book about <cite>version 4</cite> while <a class="reference external" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/changelog.html">Foundation 5</a> has been out since
November 21, 2013.</p>
